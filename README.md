# 🌐 Monitoring VPC Traffic with CloudWatch: AWS Networking & Monitoring Project

---

## Project Overview  
I set up a solution to monitor traffic flow within **Amazon VPCs** using **CloudWatch** and **VPC Flow Logs**. This project focused on analysing VPC traffic, ensuring proper network security, and improving performance through real-time insights.

---

## Project Highlights  
### What I Did:  
- 🏗 **Set Up Two VPCs with Peering**: Configured two VPCs and established peering for traffic flow.  
- 📊 **Enabled VPC Flow Logs**: Set up VPC Flow Logs to capture network traffic data and send it to **CloudWatch** for analysis.  
- 🔍 **Analysed Traffic Using Log Insights**: Used **Log Insights** to analyse and monitor traffic patterns and troubleshoot any issues.  
- 🌍 **Tested VPC Peering**: Verified connectivity using both private and public IP addresses.

---

### Next Phase:  
- 🔒 **Security Enhancements**: Implement additional **NACLs** and **security groups** to filter unwanted traffic.  
- 📈 **Optimisation & Automation**: Set up **CloudWatch Alarms** for traffic anomalies and automate log retention policies.  
- 🛠 **Advanced Traffic Analysis**: Dive deeper into traffic patterns with custom log filters and queries.

## Why CloudWatch & VPC Flow Logs?  
**CloudWatch** and **VPC Flow Logs** provide invaluable insights into the health and performance of your cloud network. By monitoring traffic and using **Log Insights**, I gained a clearer understanding of my network's behaviour, enabling me to take proactive security and performance measures.
